GLOBAL OBJECTIVE

Create copy that:

Turns visitors into calls and requests (primary goal = call / request service).

Targets local SEO for each page:

Primary keyword on every service page = "<Service Name> {{SERVICE_AREA}}".

Use it once in the main headline and 1–2 times in body copy naturally.

Feels human, specific, and unique on every page.

No generic, boilerplate text across pages.

NON-REPETITION & VARIETY RULES (CRITICAL)

You MUST follow all of these:

No copy/paste across pages.

Do not reuse full sentences, taglines, or hero intros from any other page.

Vary your adjectives and phrases.

Avoid repeating the same adjectives more than once per page (e.g., don’t say “fast, reliable, affordable” 5 times).

Across the entire site, rotate vocabulary (e.g., vary between “rapid response”, “quick arrival”, “prompt dispatch”, “on-the-way in minutes”).

Unique angle per service page.
For every service page (e.g., Towing vs Jump Start vs Tire Change), choose a distinct angle:

Speed/response time

Specialized equipment

Technician expertise

Safety & care for the vehicle

Transparent pricing / no surprises

Local knowledge / coverage
Make sure each service page leans on a different combination of these angles.

Avoid repeating stock phrases across pages, such as:

“Your go-to roadside assistance provider”

“We’re here when you need us most”

“Day or night, we’ve got you covered”
If you must use a similar idea, rewrite it in a new way with different structure and word choice.

Vary sentence structure and openings.

Don’t start every paragraph with “We”, “Our team”, or “At {{BUSINESS_PUBLIC_NAME}}”.

Mix in customer-focused openings (“Stuck with a flat in {{SERVICE_AREA}}?”), benefit-led openings, and question hooks.

Think of each page as written in the same voice, but as a different sales pitch.

CONVERSION PRINCIPLES

For all pages:

Write for a stressed, impatient visitor stuck on the roadside or needing a tow now.

Lead with:

What you do specifically on this page

Where you do it ({{SERVICE_AREA}} and key nearby areas)

How fast you respond / what they can expect next

Use:

Clear, urgent CTAs (“Call {{PHONE}} Now for Fast Help”, “Tap to Request a Tow in {{SERVICE_AREA}}”)

Benefits > features (e.g., “back on the road in under an hour” vs “fast service”)

Proof where possible (years in business, 5-star reviews, licensed/insured, local reputation).

Make it extremely obvious:

What the visitor should do next (call / request service)

That the service is local to {{SERVICE_AREA}}

That emergencies are welcome and expected.

GENERAL RULES

Do not change layout or HTML structure.

Only replace the text strings that contain “Prompt”.

Each prompt label must become final customer-ready copy:

No instructions

No “Prompt:” wording

No placeholders or curly braces except provided values (e.g., {{PHONE}}).

Mention {{SERVICE_AREA}} and relevant services naturally for SEO; avoid keyword stuffing.

CTA labels must be:

Action-oriented (e.g., “Call {{PHONE}} Now”, “Request a Jump Start in {{SERVICE_AREA}}”)

Consistent with the page’s primary action (usually phone call).

Use:

American English

Concise sentences

Tone: professional, confident, and as urgent as is natural for roadside, while matching {{BRAND_VOICE}}.

When a field asks for a value or headline with constraints (word count, character limit, content requirements), obey those constraints exactly.

For all image alt text fields:

Use the associated service + location

Describe what’s happening in ≤120 characters

Example: "Tow truck loading sedan for light duty towing in {{SERVICE_AREA}}".

If testimonials are missing:

Create believable 30–40 word quotes referencing the specific service and location.

Use realistic names. Do not overhype beyond believable language.

Ensure all buttons/links that are supposed to include the phone number actually contain {{PHONE}}.

Never mention services outside {{SELECTED_SERVICES}}.

If {{OPERATING_HOURS}} is blank:

Explicitly state "24/7 emergency availability" in relevant fields.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return JSON keyed by page id ("home", "service-{{slug}}", "contact").

Each value is an object whose keys exactly match the template field identifiers supplied by the bot.

Example:

{
  "home": {
    "hero.eyebrow": "...",
    "hero.headline": "...",
    "hero.subheadline": "...",
    "hero.primaryCtaLabel": "...",
    "hero.secondaryCtaLabel": "...",
    "...": "..."
  },
  "service-jump-start": {
    "...": "..."
  },
  "contact": {
    "...": "..."
  }
}

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT SKIP)

Before responding, you MUST ensure:

Every field from TEMPLATE_FIELDS exists in your JSON response.

No missing keys.

If a field exists in TEMPLATE_FIELDS, it must be included in the JSON with final copy.

No prompt text remains.

All prompt labels replaced with user-facing copy.

No “Prompt:” or instructional wording.

Alt text fields are populated with descriptive, location-aware alt text.

CTA labels:

Are specific to the page’s service and {{SERVICE_AREA}}

Include {{PHONE}} whenever instructed.

Service pages:

Clearly highlight their specific service + {{SERVICE_AREA}}

Use the primary keyword ("<Service Name> {{SERVICE_AREA}}") in the main headline and once or twice in the body naturally.

Language variety checks:

No obvious repeated stock phrases or identical sentences across pages.

Adjectives and benefit statements are varied per page.

Only after all of the above are satisfied should you output the JSON.
