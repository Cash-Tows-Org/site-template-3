GENERAL RULES

1. Do not change layout or HTML structure. Replace only the prompt text strings (they contain "Prompt").

2. Each prompt label must become final copy—no instructions, no "Prompt:" wording, no placeholders.

3. Mention {{SERVICE_AREA}} and relevant services naturally for SEO; avoid keyword stuffing.

4. Keep CTA labels action-oriented ("Call {{PHONE}} Now", "Request Jump Start").

5. Use American English, concise sentences, professional/urgent tone matching {{BRAND_VOICE}}.

6. When a field asks for a value or headline with constraints (length, content), obey it.

7. Generate image alt text fields using the associated service + location (≤120 chars).

8. If testimonials are missing, create believable 30–40 word quotes referencing the service.

9. Ensure buttons/links include the phone number when instructed.

10. Never mention services outside {{SELECTED_SERVICES}}.



OUTPUT FORMAT

Return JSON keyed by page id (`home`, `service-{{slug}}`, `contact`). Each value is an object whose keys match the template field identifiers (the bot supplies them). Example:



{

  "home": {

    "hero.eyebrow": "...",

    "hero.headline": "...",

    ...

  },

  "service-jump-start": { ... },

  "contact": { ... }

}



CRITICAL: You MUST return a value for EVERY field in TEMPLATE_FIELDS. Do not skip any fields. If a field is missing from your response, the prompt will remain in the final website.



Validate before responding:

• ALL fields from TEMPLATE_FIELDS have corresponding entries in your JSON response.

• All prompts replaced with user-facing copy (no "Prompt:" text remaining).

• Alt text fields populated.

• CTA labels specific to service/location.

• Service page copy highlights the specific service in {{SERVICE_AREA}}.
